# game Repo!

This repository contains several games, started by edude15000. 

Current development is focused on the miniRPG - start the game by running the game/src/miniRPG/StartGameGui.java file.
Alternatively, run game/src/miniRPG/Play.java to play the command line version, which has a fuller set of features.
